# KeycloakAuth
This repository contains a complete, containerized application stack demonstrating a modern microservices architecture. It includes a secure .NET Web API, an API Gateway, a Keycloak identity server, and Jaeger for distributed tracing.

The entire system is orchestrated with `docker-compose`, allowing you to launch all services with a single command.

## Architecture Overview

This project consists of four main services working together:

1.  **`keycloak.auth.proxy` (API Gateway)**
2.  **`keycloak.auth.api` (.NET Backend Service)**: The core business logic resides here. This service is protected by Keycloak and handles the main functionality of the application.
3.  **`keycloak` (Identity Server)**: The centralized authentication and authorization service. It manages users, roles, and issues JWTs.
4.  **`jaeger` (Distributed Tracing)**: Collects and visualizes traces from both the API Gateway and the backend service, providing end-to-end observability of requests.

## Key Features

-   **Docker-Compose Setup**: Launch the entire multi-service stack with one command.
-   **Secure Authentication**: The backend API (`keycloak.auth.api`) is secured using JWTs from Keycloak.
-   **End-to-End Observability**: Distributed tracing is enabled across the gateway and the API using **Jaeger** and **OpenTelemetry**.
-   **Persistent Data**: Keycloak data is persisted in a Docker volume, so users and configurations are not lost on restart.
